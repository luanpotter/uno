# Special Rules

This collection contains the most common and interesting independent special rules that are not include in the official rule book, but are commonly found among avid players.

Some of them define a new kind of card; this card should be a specific specially selected Regular Card. The Rule Sets often will say which card is suggested; for example, if a Rule Set says it includes:

> Slap Rule (7)

It means it's using the Slap Rule, and the Slap Card is the 7. Of course these are merely suggestions based on common usages found across our investigations, and any card can be used, as long as it's properly specified in the beginning of the game. The only exception is the 0 card, that has a special property: there is only one zero per Color per deck (making it twice as scarce as the others). Assign a Special Rule to the 0 Card if its effect is desired to be rarer than the others.

## Accumulation Rule

This is a very common rule that most people decide to add, but there is not much consensus on how it works. The following description is our favorite version.

Whenever a Draw card is played, a Draw Chain is started. It targets the next player in the line, and he can draw the cards specified. However, he can, instead, play a valid card that's Draw Card, a Skip Card or a Reverse Card (i.e., any Special Card except the Choose Color Card). If he does so, he excuses himself from the obligatory draw, and the following happens, according to the card played:

* Draw Card: sum this card Draw value to the current chain and target the next player in the line. For example, if someone throws a Draw 2 card to a player, he can play any other Draw 2 card to make the next player in the line to draw 4 cards (and so on, if the next player also has a valid card to play).
* Skip card: instead of skipping the next player, the Skip Card can be used in this context to skip oneself, and make the Chain target the next player in the line.
* Reverse Card: changes the direction of the game and targets the new next player (or the previous previous player) on the line for the Draw.

## Silence Rule

This rule defines a new kind of card: the Silence Card.

If the Silence Card is played, no player can say anything. Laughs, coughs and sneezes are allowed. If a player speaks, he must draw 3 cards, and the Silence is over. If a Silence Card is played while in Silence, the Silence ends as well.

If a player needs to Uno while on Silence Rule, he can double tap the table (as specified in the "UNO&reg;" section of the [Basic+ Rules](basic-plus-rules.md)).

## Slap Rule

This rule defines a new kind of card: the Slap Card.

Whenever a player discards the Slap Card, every player must slap their hand on top of the discard pile, and leave it there. This will form a pile of hands, with the last player to fulfill this requirement having his hand on top. After the last player has been determined, everyone can retrieve their hands and the last player must draw 3 cards.

If a player slaps inappropriately, only he draws 3 cards as well (players who followed him to not, as there was no way to know).

One can pretend to slap to bait other players into wrong-slapping, but if one does slap wrongly, one must draw (and the other players don't).

If there is just one person left to slap, the Slap Rule can be shortcut and the last person draws 3 cards.

## Cut Rule (+ Double Play Rule)

This is the most game-changing and interesting rule from this list. Basically, at any moment, if a player have a card that's identical to the one on top of the Discard Pile, he can immediately discard it ("cut"), and the line proceeds from him (maintaining the current orientation).

If several players try to play at the same time, one will succeed to place his card on top of the pile (or better positioned on the top); that's the player who gets the cut; the others must retrieve their cards.

Even with this rule, only one player can play at a time; therefore, this doesn't break the winning condition; there can only be one winner, and no draws.

This has the edge case of cutting oneself; that's absolutely allowed, and even more so, one can play two identical cards together (to leave no chance of someone cutting before).

This rule makes the game tense and incredibly entertaining for every player the whole game, even outside his turn.

## Hand Swap Rule

This rule defines a new kind of card: the Hand Sawp Card.

Any player that discards the Hand Swap card can, if desired, immediately swap hands with another player of his choice. No cards can be discarded while the swap is taking place.

## Invalid Play Rule

If a player makes an Invalid Play, he must undo his action and draw 3 cards. Any other consequences of his play are negated.

Note that what constitutes an Invalid Play must be made clear. Not Uno'ing, not slapping the Slap Card, or breaking the Silence Rule are not Invalid Plays, as they are expected to happen and have specific penalties. Invalid Plays involve playing an invalid card, playing when it's not one's turn, et cetera.

It's specially important in more official competitions to establish a max turn time (say, 15 seconds), after which not playing when should be required becomes an Invalid Play. Then, not discard nor drawing when it is one's turn, not drawing because of an effect, et cetera, become Invalid Plays.

This rule can be added to any rule set to punish players if they make an invalid move. This rule is specially interesting when played together with the Silence Rule, as nothing can be explained, and if a player gets lost, he might take several mistakes to understand what's going on. The Cut Rule with Reverse Cards is specially confusing; if done during Silence, a few Invalid Plays are most certainly to occur, for everyone's entertainment.
