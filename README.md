# UNO&reg; Revamped

Have you ever played UNO&reg;? Few people can say they haven't. From its humble beginning with Mau-Mau and other Playing Cards variants, it has grown to be one of the most famous party games ever, entertaining people around the globe.

One common situation is shared by every player, though: no one can settle on the rules. Any ruleset can be used, as long as properly defined at the beginning. This is what this repository aims to do: help you to choose and define the best rule set for you, showing the official rules (Basic), that are often mistaken and confused, show an improved version, the Basic+, and also some Special Rules to spice up your game.

## What will you find here?

If you are new to game, check out the [Basic+](basic-plus-rules.md). It includes a very compact yet complete vanilla ruleset, without ambiguities or unnecessary additions. It also has a Diff section, that you can read if you know the gist of the game and just want to see the details.

If you are a seasoned player, the [Advanced](advanced.md) ruleset is just what you were looking for! The Basic+ enhanced with a handpicked collection of Special Rules selected from a repertoire build after more than 10 years of personal UNO&reg; experience.

Some [Definitions](definitions.md) that might be useful while reading the guides.

[Cards](cards.md) describes the Deck used, cards available.

[Special Rules](special-rules.md) list all the Special Rules available, with detailed descriptions.

[First Player and Matches](first-player-matches.md) discusses a bit about how to select the First Player and how to play and properly score many games in a row (Matches); those are not included in the rulesets.

Soon I intend to add more about: variant brands, playing with a deck of Playing Cards, history and more.

## Ideals

These rulesets were created based on the following ideals:

* Make UNO&reg; a more skill-based game, comparable to other high-level famous card games, instead of a almost purely luck-based statistical game.
* The skills required are quick thinking, awareness, dexterity and strategy, and those are evenly balanced, with a touch of luck.
* Rules are simple, strategies are complex (e.g., unnecessary clutter rules are remove, numbers are simplified: every penalty is a Draw 3).
* Consistency: the Basic+ has a very strong internal consistency, and every Special Rules plays very nicely with the others, allowing for complex strategies.
