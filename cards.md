# Cards

The deck of UNO&reg; consists of 108 cards, which are described below. Apart from those, normally the pack comes with 4 extra blank cards (and the manual and the box). These cards are not part of the deck and should not be included, but they can be used to replace any missing cards.

## Design

Each card is 56.5 mm wide and 87 mm tall and has rounded corners of radius of about 3 mm; the backs are all equal, featuring a 4 mm pure white border, a black background inside and a tilted red oval in the middle, with the trademark UNO&reg; written as the yellow-ish logo and a small &copy; Mattel white signature at the bottom right.

Each front have a simple minimalist design with a white border of about 4 mm (identical to the backs), a background of a specific color, two values in the top left and bottom right corners and a figure in the middle, inside a white tilted oval. The values are always equal, and are often equal to the middle, except when differently specified.

## Composition

The background colors are one of the following 5 options: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Black. The color of the cards can be seen in the background and is the most predominant color featured. The cards that are not Black are defined as Colored Cards.

Each color of the Colored Cards has 25 cards, being:

* 19 Number Cards (or Regular Cards, from now on), they have a number in the middle. There are one 0 card and two of each of the other digits (1-9, inclusive).
* 2 Draw 2 Cards, they feature two cards drawn in the middle and have the value of +2
* 2 Skip Cards, they feature the empty set symbol (the âˆ… letter)
* 2 Reverse Cards, they feature a double pointed twisted arrow in the middle

Finally, the Black cards are:

* 4 Choose Color Card (called in the official manual Wild Card), it features a disk with the four other colors in it
* 4 Draw 4 Card (called in the official manual Wild Draw 4 Card), it features 4 cards, one of each of the other colors, and has a value of +4
