# First Player and Matches

## First Player Decision Rule

There is no consensus among on how to decide the first player. The official Mattel&copy; 's UNO&reg; guide, available [here](https://service.mattel.com/instruction_sheets/42001pr.pdf), says:

> The player to the left of the dealer plays first.

Normally, however, it's preferred to leave the dealer's job out of the game, because it can be logistically simplified without in-game impact -- this is not a cheating game, and sleight of hand is not allowed. So binding these two my result in players needing to deal without wanting, while others might like the job.

Therefore, the following rules are proposed, one of which can be chosen democratically to always use with the group:

* The youngest/oldest player starts: this rule provides fun off-game in the process of finding out people's ages, which always turn up to be entertaining, but if one always plays with the same people the outcome will always be the same (not if one is playing a Match, check Matches' rules [here](#Match Rules)). This also is not suitable for competition, as it's intrinsically discriminatory.
* The first who called out / the owner of the deck starts: again, this is not suitable for competitions or if one plays with the same people regularly, but it has the advantage of being the easiest and simplest way to start (if no one cares about the unfairness).
* Use a hand game, like Jan-Ken-Pon (for two players), Ones-And-Twos (for small groups, the odd-man-out starts, repeat until successfully) or Morra (for larger groups, repeat until successfully).
* Use a truly random method, like a dice throw, higher card starts, or our personal favorite app [Chwazi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tendadigital.chwaziApp&hl=en). The higher cards is a good truly random method that does not require any additional infrastructure, as the UNO&reg; deck itself can be used. However, it requires an ordering of the cards. A simple suggestion follows: a card with a number has that value (Regular Cards or Draw Cards), other cards have a value of 10 (Skip, Reverse and Choose Color cards). If tied in first, only those who tied redraw, until a single person is selected.

## Match Rules

A Single is a single game following these rules, and has a single winner (draws are impossible). The suggested Match format uses these additional rules:

* Play any number of games (choose beforehand or left it open until someone needs to leave); of course, if it's a high stakes competition, it needs to be decided beforehand.
* The next player clockwise to the first player of the previous game is the new first player. That's because the game runs clockwise by default, and that will make the previous first player be last player this turn (*a priori*).
* The winner gets a point.

Wins the match the player with the most points.

Running a match will eventually diminish any potential advantage or disadvantage of the first player; however, as there are several elements of luck in the game, playing a single game does not hugely affect the overall role of luck.
