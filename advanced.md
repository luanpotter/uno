# Advanced Rules

This is the best ruleset for experienced players.

Use the [Basic+](basic-plus-rules.md) ruleset (go read that if you are unfamiliar).

On top of that, the following [Special Rules](special-rules.md) are added:

* Accumulation Rule
* Silence Rule (0)
* Slap Rule (7)
* Cut Rule (+ Double Play Rule)

Also, the Invalid Play Rule can be optionally added only if properly democratically agreed in the beginning of the game (3 cards penalty, 15 seconds per turn).

## Motivations

This leaves out the Swap Hand Rule, as its unpredictable and overpowered nature it doesn't seem good for strategic thinking.

The Silence Card is selected as the 0 (least common card), because, although remembering and getting everything right requires a great deal of attention and skill, it is not so fun to spend the whole game quiet. It looks like the zero is the perfect balance for it in terms of maximizing fun and engagement.

The 7 is chosen as the Slap Card for historical reasons; since it's so common, we might as well stick to it.

The Invalid Play Rule is not added by default because it's very frustrating and punitive for players who are most likely widely unaware of the Special Rules added by the Advanced ruleset (normally only a few players know these). The goal of this repository is to make the Advanced rules more available and common, so we don't recommend starting using the Invalid Play Rule with newer players. It is mentioned though, as it is indispensable for more official plays and tournaments, as well as it can be really engaging for more advanced consistent groups.
