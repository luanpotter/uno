# Basic+ Rules

## Introduction

This is our favorite basic ruleset (no special rules included), and it's very similar to the official rules, with a few differences.

Reading the full version is recommend (below, it's very compact), but if one has a basic understanding of how Uno&reg; works, one can read just the [Diff](#diff) section, as it will list the differences, plus some confusing points people often disagree. Also, one can check the [Explanations](#explanations) section, that will mention all differences and common misconceptions and add motivations behind the choices made in Basic+.

When in doubt, check the [Definitions](definitions.md) file for clarifications about the terms used here. Also, check the [Cards](cards.md) for the name given to the cards and how to identify each one.

## Setup

Shuffle all cards and deal a hand of **seven** cards for each player, face-down. That becomes their Hands; the rest of the deck becomes the Draw Pile (put it face-down in the table).

Decide the first player using a fair random method (see detailed discussion [here](first-player-matches.md)).

The first player, before his turn, must excavate a card from the top of the Draw Pile, put it in the Discard Pile and immediately resolve it, applying the effect on himself (as if it was played by the player on his right). If it's a Black Card, he can choose the color.

After that, the first player's turn start immediately, and the game start running clockwise, meaning each player to the left of the current player plays the next turn. A player's turn starts immediately after the previous player's turn finishes.

## Turn

On his turn, each player must do exactly one of the following:

* Discard a valid card on top of the Discard Pile
* Draw one card

Doing both or passing is not an option.

A **valid card** is a card that satisfies one of the following:

* Has the same symbol as the card on top of the Discard Pile
* Has the same color as the card on top of the Discard Pile
* Is a Black Card

Then, the player must immediately resolve the card's effect, and the next player on the line starts his turn.

## Winning

There is only one winning condition; a player that has zero cards in his hands win immediately. There is always one winner per game and a draw is impossible.

## Card Effects

Some cards have special effects that are activated when they are discarded; these are:

* Choose Color Card: The player upon playing this card must choose one of the four Colored Colors; this card becomes of that color while on top of the Discard Pile.
* Draw Card: The next player on the line must draw the specified number of cards and looses his turn. If it's a Draw 4 Card, the player must also change it's color for one of the four colored colors (similar to the Choose Color Card)
* Skip Card: Skips the next player turn.
* Reverse Card: Reverse the direction of play (from CCW to CW or vice-versa).

## UNO&reg;

Why is the game called UNO&reg;, though? There is one additional and beloved rule: if a player has exactly one card in his hand, he should Uno, i.e., say "Uno!" out loud.

If someone notices a player hasn't Uno'ed, and he still has one card (can't be done retroactively), they can call him out and he must draw **3** cards.

If someone calls a player out inappropriately, they draw **3** cards instead.

If no one notices, a player who hasn't Uno'ed doesn't need to do anything.

If a player Uno's incorrectly, he draws **3** cards.

Alternatively, a player can also double tap the table to Uno (it has the same effect).

A player can Uno as many times as he wants, as long as he still has one card.

# Diff

* Anyone can deal, the first player is determined by a random method;
* Deal 7 cards for each player;
* The first player excavate the first card when ready; its effect is activated immediately, targeting the first player (if it's a black card, he chooses the color);
* You can play a Black Card any time, even if you have other options or if it's your last card;
* You can either Discard one or Draw one, and not both (you can Draw even if you have valid cards to play);
* The penalty for not Uno'ing, if noticed, is to draw 3 -- the same for wrong accusing. There is no penalty if unnoticed;
* You can't "accumulate" or "repass" a Draw Card in the official rules; that's a [Special Rule](special-rules.md), and it's not included in the Basic+ set.

# Explanations

This section explains the differences from the rules described here (Basic+) and the official rules, including the motivations and explanations.

## First Player Decision

The official rules select the dealer by highest card drawn, and the first player to his left. Basic+ doesn't include a dealer role, and the first player must be decided randomly. You can see a in-depth discussion about this [here](first-player-matches.md).

## Starting cards

In the official rules, if the first card discarded from the deck is a black card, it must be reshuffled.

Basic+ rules say:

> The first player, before his turn, must excavate a card from the top of the Draw Pile, put it in the Discard Pile and immediately resolve it, applying the effect on himself (as if it was played by the player on his right). If it's a Black Card, he can choose the color.

This was changed to reduce the number of edge cases, as each rule has a special case as to what happens if it's the first play; this allows for any special or extra rules to be simpler.

## Black Cards Limitations

In the official rules, a player can't play a Draw 4 card unless that's the only possible card he can play; this rule can be broken but the target of the Draw 4 can challenge the player who played. All this is removed in Basic+, to allow for more strategic plays, instead of adding a Bluff element.

Also, in the official rules, it's forbidden to win with a Black Card. Again, this was removed, to allow for more strategic plays.

## Play after Draw

In the official rules, a player can only draw if he has no options. Near the end of the rulebook, though, the Reneging rule is mentioned, allowing a player to draw even without need. Again, this unverifiable rule was removed to make the game simpler and more strategic.

Also, if a player has no option, he must draw one, but he can play the card you draw afterwards. This was removed as to make a turn simpler, its end obvious and don't overpower the draw option.

In Basic+, a player can draw any turn if he so desires, but he must do it instead of discarding (not both).

One very important aspect to note is to never use the rule "draw until you have a valid card". This rule, in all our play tests, generated endless games, that would just drag on forever and ever. People often forget the official rules and make this mistake, basically ruining their first play of the day.

## Uno Penalties

The penalties for not Uno'ing or wrong accusing changed to 3 cards, to match those of special rules. As the addition of special rules make it much more common to apply such penalties, the unified amount was reduced to 3 cards.

## No Scoring

All the Scoring rules where removed, because no one uses then, they are complex and unnecessary. Check other suggestions for Matches [here](first-player-matches.md).

Also, extra rules for two players, challenges, multiple tables, and some others were removed, as they were just cluttering the rulebook.
